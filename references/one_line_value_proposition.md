# One-line Value Proposition

## Purpose

The One-line Value Proposition defines, in a single sentence, **what the reader will be able to do after completing the tutorial**.

It is **not** a background introduction or a conceptual definition.  
It is a compressed statement of the **final, concrete capability or artifact** the reader will obtain.

## When to Write

Write this section **before** the main content. It serves to:

- Let readers quickly decide whether the tutorial is worth reading
- Make the intended deliverable explicit
- Constrain the scope of the article and prevent topic drift

## Writing Requirements

A valid One-line Value Proposition **must** satisfy all of the following:

1. **Describe a concrete capability or output**
   - Build / implement / deploy / learn / design something
2. **Point to an engineering outcome**
   - A system, component, workflow, demo, tool, or API
   - Prefer *runnable demos* or *reusable engineering patterns*
