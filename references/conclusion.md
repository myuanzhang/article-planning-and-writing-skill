# Conclusion

## Output Format

The section heading should be: `## Conclusion`

**DO NOT** use additional subheadings (###, ####) within this section. Write in 2-3
paragraphs that naturally flow from one to the next.

## Content Structure

### Paragraph 1: Core Summary (1-2 sentences)

Reinforce the core idea — what this technology is and what problem it solves.
Avoid re-introducing concepts; focus on the key takeaway.

### Paragraph 2: When to Use It (1-2 sentences)

Help readers decide if this approach is right for their use case. Be specific about
ideal scenarios.

### Paragraph 3: Limitations (Optional, 1-2 sentences)

Acknowledge what this technology is NOT good for. Be honest about trade-offs.

## Writing Guidelines

- Be **honest and grounded**, not promotional
- Avoid visionary language or hype
- Do NOT introduce new concepts
- Focus on **decision-making guidance**
- Keep it concise — 2-4 paragraphs total

## Quality Bar

A reader should finish this section thinking:

> "I understand when to use this approach and when to consider alternatives. I have
> a realistic sense of its limitations, not just hype."

## Reference Pattern (Deep Agents)

## Conclusion

Deep Agents represent a significant evolution in agent architecture, moving beyond
simple tool-calling to sophisticated systems capable of planning, delegation, and
sustained execution on complex tasks. The deepagents package makes this
architecture accessible, allowing developers to build production-ready agents for
research, coding, analysis, and specialized domains.

As AI agents become essential in business and research, deep agent architectures
provide the structure and flexibility needed for real-world impact. If you're
looking for a no-code solution, I also recommend checking out the LangSmith Agent
Builder tutorial.

## Additional Reference Pattern (RAG)

## Conclusion

RAG is a pattern, not a product. It solves a specific problem: **augmenting LLMs
with external knowledge at inference time.** Use it when you need factual,
verifiable answers from your documents with source attribution. Don't use it for
creative writing or general conversation — simpler approaches work better there.

The quality of a RAG system depends entirely on retrieval quality and document
preparation. Start simple with dense retrieval and basic chunking, then add
complexity only when measurements show it's needed.
