# Article Planning and Writing Skill

A Claude Skill for generating end-to-end engineering tutorials that introduce complex systems, decompose their architecture, and walk through reproducible, real-world demos.

## Overview

This Skill is designed for engineers and technical writers who need to document **how a system actually works in practice**, not just surface-level concepts.

It enforces a structured learning flow:

**Why → What → How → Demo → Reflection**

Each tutorial produced with this Skill explains:
- **Why** the system exists and what problems it solves
- **What** its core concepts and architectural components are
- **How** those components work together
- **How to build** a reproducible, real-world demo
- **When to use** the approach—and when not to

## Execution Flow

The skill follows a three-phase workflow:

### Phase 1: Article Planning
- Analyze technical scope and depth
- Generate a complete section-level outline
- Ensure proper Why → What → How → Demo → Reflection progression

### Phase 2: Section-by-Section Writing
- Each section is written independently
- Follows writing rules from corresponding reference files
- No cross-section references during writing

### Phase 3: Assembly & Save
- Review for terminology consistency
- Ensure architectural coherence
- Save final article to a `.md` file

## Example Output

See `rag_tutorial.md` for an example tutorial generated by this skill.
