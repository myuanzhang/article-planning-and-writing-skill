## RAG in Practice: Build a Production-Ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation System From Scratch

**Learn what Retrieval-Augmented Generation is, how its components work together, and how to build a production-ready knowledge base assistant from scratch using vector search and LLMs.**

## Motivation & Problem Context

Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with information...

## What Is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is an architecture that...

## Key Components of RAG Systems

A RAG system consists of five core components...
